REST:
	Use ALL HTTP Verbs (methods) for the purpose they were originally intended
	Use consistent, well-designed URLs
	Content Negotiation (ConNeg) - XML, JSON, Tab-/CSV- delimitted, or other types



http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers - all customers
	GET http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers - retrieve all customers
	PUT http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers - modify all customers
	POST http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers - insert (into) all customers
	DELETE http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers - delete all customers

http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/1234 - Specific customer (1234 == customerId)
	GET http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/1234 - retrieve Harry's record
	PUT http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/1234 - modify Harry's existing record
	POST http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/1234 - insert Harry's new record
	DELETE http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/1234 - delete Harry's record

http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/lastName/Weasley - represents all customers with lastName of Weasley
	GET http://myserver/myapp/rest/customers/lastName/Weasley - retreive all Weasley

$resource
Which url do you prefer? 
This …

http://tic.com/Report.aspx?t=Sales&y=2015&m=03

… or this …

http://tic.com/Sales/2015/3

Why?



Reasons

SEO
Easy to type
Easy to remember
Hides implementation stack
URLs don’t have to change when the site changes.
Hackable



HI, I'm Roy Fielding, the inventor of REST.
REST is ...
an architectural style …
for addressing resources …
in a stateless environment …
that reduces coupling


A RESTful URL is one that conforms to all of the constraints

Separation between client and server
Stateless communication
Cacheable
A layered system
A uniform interface


Use HTTP methods to specify the action
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE



The URL should act as an API

GET http://tic.com/Customer
POST http://tic.com/Customer
GET http://tic.com/Customer/71
PUT http://tic.com/Customer/71
DELETE http://tic.com/Customer/71
GET http://tic.com/Department
GET http://tic.com/Employee
POST http://tic.com/AddToCart/17





RESTful requests are Ajax requests

It  hits the same URL
It does so multiple times
The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) reflects the intent

$resource is built to handle that pattern




$resource involves two phases

1. Setup
var xRequest = $resource(url);
2. Running
var x = xRequest.get(data)
var x = xRequest.query(data)
var x = xRequest.save(data)
var x = xRequest.remove(data)
var x = xRequest.delete(data)

The setup is done once.  The running may happen over and over.






$resource handles the async problem differently

The methods immediately return an unpopulated object.  When the 200-series response hits, Angular populates that object with the data.
So:
Set up (var r = $resource('someUrl');)
Make a .get()/.query()/.save()/.remove() call ($scope.foo = r.get({ somekey: somevalue});)
foo is emptied, so the view clears all bindings
We wait for a response from the server
A 200 response hits.
$scope.foo gets populated by Angular from the response
foo is no longer empty, so the view is populated
Much rejoicing occurs



A $resource example

app.controller('itemController', 
function ($scope, itemService) {
  $scope.readItem = function (id) {
    $scope.item = itemService.get({'id':id});
  };
});

When readItem(123) is called, the .get() immediately returns an empty item so $scope.item is blank which empties the fields on the view. 
When the server returns a 200, Angular re-populates $scope.item with yummy data that it got from the server.
